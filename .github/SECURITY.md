# Security Policy

## Overview

CFHub iOS follows a security-first approach with AI-assisted development practices. This document outlines our security model, vulnerability reporting process, and secure development guidelines.

## üîí Security Model

### Core Security Principles

1. **No Client-Side Credentials**: CFHub iOS never stores or handles credentials directly
2. **Proxy Authentication**: All API communications go through secure proxy servers
3. **Swift 6 Concurrency**: Memory-safe concurrent operations using actors
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all application boundaries
5. **Minimal Attack Surface**: Integration-first architecture limits exposure

### Architecture Security

```
[Mobile App] ‚Üí [Secure Proxy] ‚Üí [Service APIs]
     ‚Üë              ‚Üë               ‚Üë
  No Creds     Authentication    Actual Creds
```

- **Mobile Application**: Contains no credentials, certificates, or secrets
- **Secure Proxy**: Handles authentication, rate limiting, and request validation  
- **Service APIs**: Never directly accessible from mobile application

## üö® Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x.x   | :x:                |

Only the latest major version receives security updates.

## üì¢ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. **Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@[your-domain].com`
2. **Subject**: `[CFHub iOS Security] Brief description`
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix deployment (coordinated disclosure)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Development Security

#### AI-Assisted Development
- All AI-generated code undergoes human security review
- Security patterns are enforced through quality gates
- AI attribution helps track code provenance

#### Secure Coding Practices
```swift
// ‚úÖ Secure: No hardcoded credentials
let config = IntegrationConfiguration(
    baseURL: proxyURL,
    authentication: .bearer(token: proxyToken),
    timeout: 30
)

// ‚ùå Insecure: Never do this
let apiKey = "sk_live_abc123..." // NEVER!
```

### Build Security

#### Quality Gates
```bash
# Security validation in CI/CD
./scripts/validate-standards.sh
- Build validation
- Test coverage check  
- Secret scanning
- AI attribution validation
```

#### Dependency Management
- Swift Package Manager only
- Regular dependency audits
- Pinned dependency versions
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### Runtime Security

#### Network Security
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Certificate pinning (where applicable)
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting and timeout handling

#### Data Protection
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Secure memory handling with Swift actors
- Input sanitization and validation
- Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Static analysis via SwiftLint
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secrets detection in CI/CD
- Integration security testing

### Manual Testing
- Security code review for all PRs
- Penetration testing (periodic)
- Threat modeling for new integrations
- Security-focused QA testing

## üö´ Security Anti-Patterns

### Never Do These
```swift
// ‚ùå Hardcoded secrets
let apiKey = "sk_abc123"

// ‚ùå Storing credentials
UserDefaults.standard.set(apiKey, forKey: "api_key")

// ‚ùå Logging sensitive data
print("API Key: \(apiKey)")

// ‚ùå Weak error handling
try! riskyOperation() // Could expose internal state

// ‚ùå Direct API calls from client
URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: serviceURL) // Bypass proxy
```

### Always Do These
```swift
// ‚úÖ Proxy authentication
let client = HTTPClient(baseURL: proxyURL)

// ‚úÖ Secure error handling
do {
    try await secureOperation()
} catch {
    logger.error("Operation failed", metadata: ["error": "\(error)"])
    throw IntegrationError.operationFailed
}

// ‚úÖ Input validation
func validateResourceName(_ name: String) throws {
    guard name.count <= 100 else {
        throw ValidationError.nameTooLong
    }
    // Additional validation...
}
```

## üîê Integration Security Guidelines

### New Integration Checklist
- [ ] All communications go through secure proxy
- [ ] No credentials stored in client code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Rate limiting and timeout handling
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Integration tests include security scenarios

### Proxy Integration Pattern
```swift
public actor SecureIntegration: Integration {
    private let client: HTTPClient
    
    public init(configuration: IntegrationConfiguration) async throws {
        // Configuration includes proxy URL, not service credentials
        self.client = HTTPClient(
            baseURL: configuration.baseURL, // Proxy URL
            authentication: configuration.authentication // Proxy auth
        )
    }
    
    public func getActualState() async throws -> [Resource] {
        // All requests go through proxy
        return try await client.get("/api/v1/resources")
    }
}
```
