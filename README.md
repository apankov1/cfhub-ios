## Vision

CFHub iOS transforms infrastructure management from a desktop-bound CLI tool into a mobile-first experience. Handle deployment emergencies, monitor infrastructure health, and collaborate with your team from anywhere.

```
📱 Developer gets alert → Opens CFHub app → Views deployment status → 
Approves hotfix → Monitors rollout → Shares status with team
```

## Architecture

### Integration-First Design

Following the cloudflare-hub pattern, CFHub iOS uses **self-contained integration modules** where each service integration owns its complete domain:

```
Sources/
├── CFHubApp/                    # SwiftUI app & orchestration
├── CFHubCore/                   # Core types & plugin system
├── CFHubClient/                 # Platform-agnostic HTTP client
└── Integrations/
    ├── CFHubCloudflare/         # Complete Cloudflare integration
    └── CFHubGitHub/             # Complete GitHub integration
```

### Key Principles

- **🔒 Zero Token Storage**: Mobile app never stores API tokens
- **🌐 Cloud-Native**: Ephemeral environments via `cfhub deploy feature/auth`
- **🎯 MVP Excellence**: Perfect one workflow before expanding
- **🤖 AI-Assisted**: 85-90% AI-generated with human oversight
- **📱 Mobile-First**: Designed for emergency response and on-the-go management

## Security Architecture

```
iOS App ←→ CFHub Cloud ←→ Local Agent ←→ Cloud APIs
   ↓           ↓              ↓           ↓
Mobile     Authentication  Plugin      Actual
  UI       & Proxying      Engine    Resources
```

**Security Benefits:**
- ✅ API tokens never leave developer's machine
- ✅ Mobile app works from anywhere
- ✅ Consistent plugin system across CLI and mobile
- ✅ Real-time updates and notifications

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- iOS 17.0+ or macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cfhub-ios.git
cd cfhub-ios

# Build all packages
swift build

# Run tests
swift test

# Run quality gates
./scripts/validate-standards.sh
```

## Package Structure

### Core Packages

- **CFHubApp**: SwiftUI application layer with MVVM + Combine
- **CFHubCore**: Core types, plugin system, and business logic
- **CFHubClient**: HTTP client abstraction for API communication

### Integration Packages

Each integration is **completely self-contained**:

- **CFHubCloudflare**: Pages, Workers, DNS, R2 management
- **CFHubGitHub**: Repository, Actions, deployment integration

## Development Standards

### Quality Gates

All code must pass these gates before commit:

```bash
swift build                    # ✅ Must compile
swift test                     # ✅ All tests pass
./scripts/lint.sh             # ✅ SwiftLint validation
./scripts/validate-types.sh   # ✅ Strict typing enforcement
```

### AI-Assisted Development

- **85-90% AI-generated code** with human oversight
- Clear attribution in commits: `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)`
- Human responsibilities: Architecture, security, requirements
- AI responsibilities: Implementation, tests, documentation

### Code Style

- **Strict Swift 6 concurrency** with `StrictConcurrency` enabled
- **No force unwrapping** outside of tests
- **Comprehensive error handling** with typed errors
- **SwiftUI best practices** with proper state management

## Feature Roadmap

### MVP (Phase 1) - Infrastructure Dashboard ✅
- [x] User authentication (OAuth with GitHub/Cloudflare)
- [x] Real-time infrastructure status dashboard
- [x] Deployment history and logs
- [x] Basic environment management (view-only)
- [x] Push notifications for deployment events

### Phase 2 - Environment Management 🚧
- [ ] Create/delete feature branch environments
- [ ] Deploy specific commits to environments
- [ ] Environment teardown and cleanup
- [ ] Resource cost tracking

### Phase 3 - Team Collaboration 📋
- [ ] Deployment approval workflows
- [ ] Team notifications and comments
- [ ] Shared environment access
- [ ] Activity feeds and audit logs

### Phase 4 - Advanced Operations 🔮
- [ ] Infrastructure metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Log streaming and search
- [ ] Rollback and emergency procedures
- [ ] Custom dashboard widgets

## Contributing

### Package Boundaries

Each package has strict boundaries:
- **No relative imports** across package boundaries
- **Type-only imports** for cross-package dependencies
- **Self-contained domains** with complete responsibility
- **Distributed types** - no central types package

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific package tests
swift test --package CFHubCore

# Generate coverage reports
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

### Integration Development

To add a new service integration:

1. Create `Sources/Integrations/CFHub{Service}/`
2. Implement the `Integration` protocol from `CFHubCore`
3. Add comprehensive tests in `Tests/Integrations/CFHub{Service}Tests/`
4. Update `Package.swift` dependencies

## Performance

- **Lazy loading** of integration modules
- **Background app refresh** for real-time updates
- **Offline-first** with intelligent caching
- **Memory efficient** with proper view lifecycle management

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily active users on mobile vs desktop CLI
- Average session duration
- Feature usage analytics

### Operational Efficiency
- Time to respond to deployment alerts
- Number of mobile-initiated deployments
- Success rate of mobile environment management

### Developer Experience
- App Store rating and reviews
- Crash-free session rate >99.9%
- Build and test execution time

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Siri Shortcuts**: "Hey Siri, deploy my feature branch"
- **Apple Watch**: Infrastructure status at a glance
- **iPad Optimization**: Split-view dashboard with detailed logs
- **SharePlay**: Collaborative debugging sessions

### Integration Expansions
- **AWS/GCP Support**: Beyond Cloudflare/GitHub
- **Monitoring Integration**: Datadog, New Relic dashboards
- **ChatOps**: Slack/Teams integration
